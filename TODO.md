# TODO: Fix Products

## Information Gathered

- src/products.js: Main product listing page with filtering, pagination, add to cart.
- src/productss.js: Redundant product listing fetching from external API, no cart functionality.
- src/adminpanel/productlist.js: Admin product list with delete and edit functionality.

## Plan

1. ✅ Fix pagination state update in src/products.js to use proper React state updates.
2. ✅ Improve quantity selector handling in src/products.js.
3. ✅ Remove or merge src/productss.js as it duplicates product listing functionality.
4. ✅ Verify and improve admin product list delete functionality and UI in src/adminpanel/productlist.js.
5. Test all changes and ensure product features work correctly.
